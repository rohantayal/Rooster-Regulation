# Rooster-Regulation

An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! It’s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the rooster is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.

You can find the rooster defined in index.js. You will write a test suite in index_test.js within the test directory using the Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library. 

A project to write fast, complete, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test using MOCHA.
